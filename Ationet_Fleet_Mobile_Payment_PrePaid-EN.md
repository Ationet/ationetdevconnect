## Introduction
This document describes how to complete a operation with PrePaid methodology.

## Authentication

Steps to Configure Basic Authentication
Credential Encoding:

Combine the username and password into a single string, separated by a colon (:).
Encode this string in Base64.
Example:

username:password

Base64 encoded:

bm9tYnJlX2RlX3VzdWFyaW86Y29udHJhc2XDsWE=


Add the Authorization Header:

Includes the Base64-encoded string in the HTTP request header.
The header format is:
Authorization: Basic <credenciales_codificadas>
Ejemplo:

Authorization: Basic bm9tYnJlX2RlX3VzdWFyaW86Y29udHJhc2XDsWE=
Make an HTTP Request:

Send the HTTP request with the Authorization header included.
The server will decode the credentials and verify them.
Example HTTP Request

GET /recurso HTTP/1.1
Host: api.ejemplo.com
Authorization: Basic bm9tYnJlX2RlX3VzdWFyaW86Y29udHJhc2XDsWE=

### Host to Site System Messaging

#### SSE General Description
Below are all the messages that the SiteSystem can receive through the SSE (Server-Sent Events) channel, using a long-lived HTTP connection.

#### FPReserveRequest

<b>Output:</b> application/json </br>
<b>Use:</b> Through this event the Host will notify the SiteSystem that it must reserve a loading position.
<b>Body:</b>
```json
{
  "id": "FPReserveRequest",
  "retry": 1,
  "event": "FPReserveRequest",
  "data": {
        "eventMessage": "fueling point reserve request event",
        "timestamp": "2009-11-20T17:30:50",
        "UMTI": "1af2f8ee-a656-45e6-8e9c-f2659f94be2f",
        "fuelingPointID": "1"
        }
}
```

<b>Definition of Fields:</b> </br>
<b>id:</b> Corresponds to the type of message that the server is notifying the SiteSystem</br>
<b>eventMessage:</b>  Description of the message type.</br>
<b>timestamp:</b> date and time of the request</br>
<b>UMTI:</b> ID of the current transaction</br>
<b>fuelingPointID:</b> Position to be reserved</br>


#### AuthorizeRequest

<b>Output:</b> application/json </br>
<b>Use:</b> Through this event, the Host will notify the SiteSystem that it must authorize a charge position. To do this, the SiteSystem must obtain the details of the notified transaction (UMTI) via a GET request (trxs/{TransactionId} method) in order to obtain the transaction details and determine the value of the transaction to be authorized. 
<b>Body:</b>
```json
{
  "id": "authorizeRequest",
  "retry": 1,
  "event": "authorizeRequest",
  "data": {
        "eventMessage": "authorize request event",
        "timestamp": "2009-11-20T17:30:50",
        "UMTI": "1af2f8ee-a656-45e6-8e9c-f2659f94be2f"
        }
}
```

<b>Definition of Fields:</b> </br>
<b>id:</b> Corresponds to the type of message that the server is notifying the SiteSystem</br>
<b>eventMessage:</b>  Description of the message type.</br>
<b>timestamp:</b> date and time of the request</br>
<b>UMTI:</b> ID of the current transaction</br>


#### FPReserveCancelRequest

<b>Output:</b> application/json </br>
<b>Use:</b> Through this event, the Host will notify the SiteSystem that an error occurred after reserving the loading slot and the flow cannot proceed. Therefore, the SiteSystem must release the reserved loading slot.
<b>Body:</b>
```json
{
  "id": "FPReserveCancelRequest",
  "retry": 1,
  "event": "FPReserveCancelRequest",
  "data": {
        "eventMessage": "authorize request event",
        "timestamp": "2009-11-20T17:30:50",
        "UMTI": "1af2f8ee-a656-45e6-8e9c-f2659f94be2f",
        "fuelingPointID": "1"
        }
}
```

<b>Definition of Fields:</b> </br>
<b>id:</b> Corresponds to the type of message that the server is notifying the SiteSystem</br>
<b>eventMessage:</b>  Description of the message type.</br>
<b>timestamp:</b> date and time of the request</br>
<b>UMTI:</b> ID of the current transaction</br>
