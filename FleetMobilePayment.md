### Entities

This section outlines the logical entities, including location options, for Mobile Payment and identifies possible physical architectures. The term “entity” is used in this
document to differentiate logical processing functionality without regard to its physical location in an implementation. 


```Mobile Payment Application (MPA):```  This entity is a software application embedded in a Mobile Device or downloaded by a consumer onto a Mobile Device, such as a smart
phone or tablet, which enables mobile payments for in-store and forecourt transactions.

```Mobile Payment Processing Application (MPPA):``` This entity is an application provided by the Mobile Payment Processor (MPP) not on the Mobile Device that is responsible for
interfacing between the Token Vault or Token/Trusted Service Provider, the MPA, the Site System, the Payment Front End Processor (PFEP), and the Loyalty Front End Processor (LFEP) in order to authorize transactions.

```Payment Front End Processor (PFEP):``` This entity is a host that facilitates the authorization of payment transactions between the MPPA or the Site System and the
Issuer networks. The standard does not dictate the processing that is performed by the PFEP for each payment method. This entity is sometimes referred to as the Front End
Processor (FEP).

```Site System:``` This entity encompasses the site equipment and components (hardware and software) and may perform the function of local card processing business rules,
such as consumer prompting, local velocity checking and receipt formatting and printing. Examples of site systems include Point of Sale (POS), Outside Sales Processor
(OSP), Electronic Payment Server (EPS) and Forecourt Device Controller (FDC).
